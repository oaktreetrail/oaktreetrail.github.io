## R vs. Python
Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

```{r }
