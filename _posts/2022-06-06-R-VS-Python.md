## R vs. Python

Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due
to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other
software you’ve used? What functionality do you like about R? What parts
do you miss about your other language? Do you consider R a difficult
language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your
experience when first learning it.)

``` r
plot(iris)
