# Data scientist
When I started a journey of pursuing a data scientist a couple of years ago, I wasn’t clear about what being a data scientist is about. But,  I was overwhelmed by the terminology like artificial intelligence, big data, IOT and machine learning in the past few years.  I didn’t know how big a big data was but I knew I had to upgrade my iPhone to get doubled and tripled size of memory and I had to pay Google for the extra space to save my document and pictures. The data has been growing in every area including my research. As gene sequencing gets cheaper and faster than before, our lab gets more experiment result as more turnaround. The manual analysis lowers the efficiency of lab work. I believe it’s time to jump in the sea of big data and get wet. 

I would like to give you the following definition if you ask me what being a data scientist is about.
A data scientist is someone who are hired by an organization to explore all aspects of the business and develop programs using programming languages like Java to perform robust analytics. The data science process includes data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. Sure, many of these steps follow statistical methods behind the scene, but they’re sealed in a more engaging and understandable wrapper.  They will also use online experiments along with other methods to help businesses achieve sustainable growth. Additionally, they can develop personalized data products to help companies better understand themselves and their customers to make better business decisions. As previously mentioned, data scientists focus on the statistical analysis and research needed to determine which machine learning approach to use, then they model the algorithm and prototype it for testing.

Here’s what the data scientist role typically demands:

•	Research and develop statistical models for analysis

•	Better understand company needs and devise possible solutions by collaborating with product management and engineering departments

•	Communicate results and statistical concepts to key business leaders

•	Use appropriate databases and project designs to optimize joint development efforts

•	Develop custom data models and algorithms

•	Build processes and tools to help monitor and analyze performance and data accuracy

•	Use predictive modeling to enhance and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation, ad targeting, and more

•	Develop company A/B testing framework and test model quality

There  are definitely  some differences  between data scientists and statisticians. 
Statisticians deal with nebulous concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing, and the proverbial argument between the “frequentists” and “Bayesians.” 
Data scientists on the other hand, closely follow the “data science process” that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. Sure, many of these steps follow statistical methods behind the scene, but they’re sealed in a more engaging and understandable wrapper. Many more people can embrace data science.

As a clinical data analysist working in a research institute, the statistical knowledge is necessary to be able to build a model into which  clinical data can fit. The starting point is usually a simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. The model is improved by addressing assumptions in the model that are violated.  Then, I need to compare the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy, which is a part of data scientist’s work. 
I believe that, given time, the fields of data science and statistics likely will converge to a common end-point. The boundary between data scientists and statisticians will eventually blur.
